# WebTop (Web Desktop)

Web Desktop (Online OS) is one of the top trends in the internet industry. The idea was to create a browser-based cross-platform system that acts as a traditional operating system, besides running web apps and performing efficiently on a low-end device.

**WebTop** is a web desktop application with apps created and designed to perform everyday life tasks, allowing the user to customize its appearance and functionality according to userâ€™s preferences.

What makes our application better than other Web Desktops, that it reduces the gap between various User Interfaces (UI) applied in Operating Systems (OS) which impacts with User Experience (UX) when using multiple OS or changing from one OS to another. That helps novice users to learn and practice on an OS, and experienced users to extend their knowledge.

But **WebTop** lacks from major issues in its current version that we are going to solve in future releases such as depending heavily on third-party APIs that may cause some limitations in application performance.

In addition to opening multiple applications simultaneously may cause high memory usage thus hanging the whole application or in worst cases, close the web browser abnormally.

**WebTop** is also not "yet another OS". It does not attempt to be a third player like any other alternative OS out there. People are not meant to uninstall their OS and use WebTop instead.
